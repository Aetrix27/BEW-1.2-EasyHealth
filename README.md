# EasyHealth

Easily Share Medical Info with Personal Doctor, by uploading documents and sending information. Patients can sign up and login as well as Doctors. The website can tell whether a patient or user is authenticated based on the sign up process. If a patient sends a document to their doctor, their ID is automatically tied to their document. The SQL relational database then ties the patient and the doctor. Doctors can also send documents and the same happens to them.

May link to phone app in the future.
